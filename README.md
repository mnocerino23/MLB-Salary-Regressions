# MLB-Salary-Regressions
In this project, I build models to predict the monetary value of an MLB player and how much compensation they should expect for their efforts. I start by cleaning and preprocessing and build separate regression models for position players and pitchers (as position players have different stats/metrics than pitchers). I use multivariate linear, ridge, lasso, decision tree, and neural network regressors throughout this project, find features that produce an effective model, and tune models using GridSearchCV in scikit-learn.
