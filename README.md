# MLB-Salary-Regressions
In this project, I build a model to predict the monetary value of an MLB player and how much compensation they should expect for their efforts. I start by cleaning and preprocessing and build separate regression models for position players and pitchers (as position players have different stats/metrics than pitchers).
